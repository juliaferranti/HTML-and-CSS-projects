				The Perro de Presa Canario is a robust breed from the Canary Islands of Spain. 
				The name of the breed is Spanish in origin and often shortened to Presa Canario. 
				When properly trained and socialized, the Presa Canario is docile, devoted, 
				and obedient to its family—however, they are natural guard dogs, highly suspicious
				of strangers, and will sometimes act aggressively toward people or animals they don’t know.
